# 💼 Expected CTC Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📘 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting a candidate’s **Expected CTC (Cost to Company)** based on various academic, professional, and experiential factors.
The system leverages **Machine Learning algorithms** to analyze candidate data and generate accurate salary predictions, assisting organizations in **recruitment planning** and **compensation benchmarking**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* To develop a machine learning model that predicts a candidate’s expected salary based on input features.
* To identify the most significant factors influencing CTC expectations.
* To demonstrate the use of data science for solving real-world HR and recruitment challenges.

---

## 🧠 What I Built

I built a predictive model that analyzes candidate data such as:

* Current CTC
* Total Work Experience
* Educational Milestones (Graduation, Post Graduation, PhD Years)
* Appraisal Rating and other professional metrics

The model outputs the **Expected CTC**, which helps in establishing a fair and data-driven compensation estimate.
